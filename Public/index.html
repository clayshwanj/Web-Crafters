            The matwana matatu culture gives a sense of belonging that brings a
            very unique sense of style to our transport sector. The landmark
            initiative was undertaken by Graff Matwana,a renowned graffiti
            artist who also is the CEO and Founder of 'Matwana Culture' which
            describes itself as the 'Home to the famous matatu culture'. Each
            matatu is normally complete with graffiti artwork, custom-designed
            interiors and exteriors, flashy lights and onboard entertainment to
            attract the attention of youthful passengers. Youth today refer to
            these means of transport as clubs on wheels, while others, museums
            on wheels. They fill up streets, especially in Nairobi, while
            blaring music as they bounce and weave through traffic.Due to set
            regulations, you will rarely witness this during the day, but if you
            manoeuvre the streets at night, rest assured that you will meet
            matatus covered with disco lights that make them stand out and
            brighten up their look. Each matatu is normally complete with
            graffiti artwork, custom-designed interiors and exteriors, flashy
            lights and onboard entertainment to attract the attention of
            youthful passengers.Matatus are affordable, convenient and sometimes
            a little chaotic, but they are the choice mode of transport for most
            Kenyans.Matatus exhibit diverse designs that feature different
            graffiti artwork of hip hop artistes, international pop stars,
            athletes, football clubs, political icons and even religion.A lot of
            time and money is invested to bring them to life, and some matatu
            owners see it as a great investment. Hurts the pocket but it is
            worthwhile. Just like any other business, the matatu business
            requires the discipline of money so that one can confidently say
            that they are earning good money. Nganyas normally ply different set
            routes and are used for inter- and intra-city travel.

            ​Global warming is the slow increase in the average tempera ture of
            the earth’s atmosphere because an increased amount of the energy
            (heat) striking the earth from the sun is being trapped in the
            atmosphere and not radiated out into space. The earth’s atmosphere
            has always acted like a greenhouse to capture the sun’s heat,
            ensuring that the earth has enjoyed temperatures that permitted the
            emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans.​Without
            our atmospheric greenhouse the earth would be very cold. Global
            warming, however, is the equivalent of a greenhouse with high
            efficiency reflective glass installed the wrong way
            around.Ionically, the best evidence of this may come from a terrible
            cooling event that took place some 1,500 years ago. Two massive
            volcanic eruptions, one year after another placed so much black dust
            into the upper atmosphere that little sunlight could penetrate.
            Temperatures plummeted. Crops failed. People died of starvation and
            the Black Death started its march. As the dust slowly fell to earth,
            the sun was again able to warn the world and life returned to
            normal. Today, we have the opposite problem. Today, the problem is
            not that too little sun warmth is reaching the earth, but that too
            much is being trapped in our atmosphere. ​ So much heat is being
            kept inside greenhouse earth that the temperature of the earth is
            going up faster than at any previous time in history. NASA provides
            an excellent course module on the science of global warming.
